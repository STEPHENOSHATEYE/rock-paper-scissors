# ROCK PAPER SCISSORS

This is a simple project given as an exercise from [The Odin Project's](www.theodinprojec.com) foundation JavaScript.

It works by first asking the user to click a rock, paper or scissors button to select their choice. This is very ideal for a smoother user experience but it was required by the scope of the exercise :).

For each click, a round is play through a function called by the event listener on the button element.

Thirdly, the user's choice is compared to the computer's choice and the winner of the round is decided by:

rock > scissors;
scissors > paper;
paper > rock;

If computer or user wins a round, they move to the next round. It's a tie, there is no winner hence, the round is replayed till there's a winner.

At the end of the game, the winner is declared.

More improvements are coming to this game as I progress through the course, WATCH OUT!!!!
