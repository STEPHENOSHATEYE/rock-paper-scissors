# ROCK PAPER SCISSORS

This is a simple project given as an exercise from [The Odin Project's](www.theodinprojec.com) foundation JavaScript.

It works by first prompting the user for rock, paper or scissors although the user have to type it manually. This can be easily done with a pop-up box for a smoother user experience but it was required by the scope of the exercise :).

After getting the user's choice, a function is called to generate the computer choice from an array of rock, paper, scissors.

Thirdly, the user's choice is compared to the computer's choice and the winner of the round is decided by:

rock > scissors;
scissors > paper;
paper > rock;

If computer or user wins a round, they move to the next round. It's a tie, there is no winner hence, the round is replayed till there's a winner.

At the end of the game, the winner is declared.
